# Welcome to DARTE-QM Tutorials

This is a site in development but hopefully it will help us all detect antiobiotic resistance in the environment with sequencing technologies.

## Tutorials

### Characterize the phylogenetic distribution of DARTE-QM primers.
### Characterize the resistance mechanisms of DARTE-QM primers.
### Identify AMRs in metagenomic sequencing datasets.
### Re-design DARTE-QM primers based on metagenomic datasets.
### Identifying the number of DARTE-QM assays in your sample.
### Sequencing diversity of DARTE-QM assay.
### Counting abundance of AMRs in your sample.
### Comparing your study to others.
