# Primer Design 101

*Note that this tutorial is in development.  If you are not associated with the GERMS lab or the DARTE-QM research project, this tutorial is not meant for you.

This documentation guides how to design primers from a list of genes.  It should be proceeded by a good understanding of our in-house primer design pipeline until someone gets around to putting together the documentation of the workflow or better yet publishes it.

This tutorial is also written specifically for performing on an ubuntu-based server.  

## Choose your favorite genes.
